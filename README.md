# TOM's Public License 
A license for open sourced software that maximizes freedom of use while protecting developers. Think of it as somewhere between the WTFPL and the MIT/BSD/etc licenses. 

Unlike most licenses, it acknowledges that because the Internet is, well, the Internet, that the license can and likely will be ignored.
